Background: Disney wants to leverage AI to enable customer experience teams to query customer reviews in natural language. Your role is to design and implement a minimal, production-oriented prototype that demonstrates how this could work in practice. You are provided with a dataset of customer reviews about their parks.

## Tasks

### Customer Experience Assesment Service
Create a FastAPI based service that:
1. Allows user to submit a question, and get LLM result back.
2. The main module should contain an Embedder 
3. The main module should contain a RAG retrieval submodule.
4. Answer generator

### Context Retrieval Service
Create a separate module that implements Context retrieval service based on FastAPI:
5. Use ChromaDB as the vector database
6. Expose API for Vector search operations
7. Expose API for data indexing operations
8. Should be a standalone service that can be consumed by the FastAPI service

### Periodic Data Pipeline
Create a periodic data pipeline that:
9. Ingests data into the vector database
10. Can be scheduled to run at regular intervals
11. Processes the DisneylandReviews.csv dataset
12. Updates the vector database with new or updated data

### Jupyter Notebook for Experimentation
13. Maintain a Jupyter notebook for data exploration and analysis
14. Use the notebook for model experimentation and RAG pipeline testing

### Docker Compose Setup
15. Create a Docker Compose configuration to run all modules
16. Include FastAPI service container
17. Include Context retrieval service container
18. Include ChromaDB container
19. Include data pipeline container (optional, can be run separately)
20. Include Jupyter notebook container (optional, for development)
